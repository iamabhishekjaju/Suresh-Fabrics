# Suresh Fabrics — Website

A simple, responsive static website for a cotton bedsheet fabric business. Edit text, images, and data in the files and deploy to Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

## How to customize
- Update contact details, GST, and address in all HTML files (search for placeholders).
- Replace images in `assets/img/` with real product photos (keep same names or update paths in `data/products.json`).
- Add/edit catalogue in `data/products.json` (fields are self-explanatory).
- Logo is `assets/logo.svg` — replace with your own.
- Colors and spacing can be tweaked in `styles.css`.

## Deployment options
- **Netlify**: drag the folder into Netlify. Forms will work automatically thanks to `data-netlify` attribute.
- **GitHub Pages**: push to a repo and enable Pages in settings.
- **Any host**: upload all files keeping the folder structure intact.

## WhatsApp & Phone
Update the `+91` numbers in HTML to your actual phone/WhatsApp. The `WhatsApp` link is prefilled with a greeting.

## SEO
Basic SEO and Schema.org JSON-LD are included. Replace `url`, phone, and social links as needed.
